      The Ethical Shoe Brand Making A Difference

<p class="lead">Just last month Beyoncé’s new ‘female empowerment’ range, Ivy Park, suffered allegations of sweatshop working conditions – that was three years after the eight-story Rana Plaza factory collapsed at the cost of 1,130 lives.  </p>
<p class="lead">
The social and environmental damage fashion can entail is disastrous, but Luis Moreno and Carolina Gil, founders of the Colombian ethical shoe brand, Mamahuhu, say it doesn’t have to be this way.  </p>
<p>In 2010, Moreno and Gil, who are a Spanish-Colombian couple, received scholarships to study Chinese economics and Chinese diplomacy, respectively, in Shanghai. Having previously studied in Madrid and Oxford, the cultural contrast was blinding. Masses of street sellers were everywhere, promoting and bartering over every product you can imagine, from t-shirts, to fans, to simmering food. Noise reverberated from all around and huge factories were commonplace as cafés. “Even though you aren’t part of the production sphere, you feel it. It is everywhere," says Luis. Encouraged by Carolina’s background in fashion and diplomacy, they set out to discover what ‘made in China’ really meant. </p>
<p>
Luis says, “We visited factories, experimenting with a shoe design and didn’t like the results. That was negative inspiration – once we saw the way they do things, the huge factories and low-skill labour, we wanted to make something beautiful, exactly the opposite way.”</p>

<p>
  <em>(Carolina Gil and her friends in Mamahuhu shoes)</em>
</p>
<p>
It’s this negative inspiration that spearheaded their idea. Escaping from the Chinese powerhouse for the holidays that same year, they travelled to Carolina’s native Colombia. In Bogotá, they found a street cobbler, who they asked to make the same custom shoe as they had in Shanghai. “We were amazed by the results,” says Luis, “The material was special. Colombian leather is high quality, with a natural touch. He only made one pair, but it was perfect. In China, quality control is done at the end. Of twenty shoes made, five might not pass. With this artisan, every piece is perfect from the beginning. Quality control happens throughout the process and that’s the difference. Right then, we knew we had to move to Colombia, so we finished our studies as fast as we could.” </p>

<h2>"That’s when our concept was born – we realised we were not employing people, we were empowering people to employ others. We had created a workshop from nothing, but it was not ours, it was the artisan’s."</h2>
<h4>Luis Moreno, Mamahuhu Cofounder</h4>
</em>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Having seen the blue leather shoe on Carolina’s Facebook, friends soon wanted their own. “We began to order 30 pairs a week from the same artisan and soon he had five people working for him. That’s when our concept was born – we realised we were not employing people, we were empowering people to employ others. We had created a workshop from nothing, but it was not ours, it was the artisan’s.” </p>
<p>
The couple created a Facebook page called ‘Mamahuhu,’ an amiable Mandarin word for ‘good’. After six months, the page had 10,000, mainly Colombian, followers. “We thought, ‘Wow. This must be something,’” says Luis. In 2012, they returned to Colombia and ran a 30-day Kickstarter, selling 250 pairs of shoes (almost 10 a day). Crucially, the orders came not from Colombia, but the States: Mamahuhu was expanding. </p>
<p>
A growing client base meant finding more artisans.  Luis and Carolina searched for street cobblers with the skill to become a master artisan, developing a network of workshops. Mamahuhu supplied orders, machines and helped artisans find workers. Word soon spread and artisans came to offer their services. They began producing matching bags, tapping in to Colombia’s specialised leather bag artisans to increase social impact. </p>

<div class="col-sm-8 col-md-offset-2 col-sm">
<p><em>(Jorge Rozo, a Columbian artisan in his workshop)</em></p>
<h1>The Business Model</h1>
<p>
Mamahuhu’s workshops are all small, with between five and ten people, and run by master artisans. Jorge Rozo is 61, with 40 years experience in the shoe industry. He was found by Carolina in 2013 in a neighbourhood in Bogotá, working as a cobbler. “Money was tight,” says Jorge, “but my main disappointment was not being able to construct shoes, to use my art. I was just doing a cobbler’s job, and I am an artisan.” With 90% of Colombian leather being exported, leather artisanship was a dying art, because the material became too expensive. </p>
<p>
In the beginning, Mamahuhu finances their workshops to establish the means to produce – leather, machinery and shoetrees – and visits daily, teaching the artisans company designs and training them in new materials. After that, they visit once a month, and it’s the artisan who delivers their products to the stores. After three years with Mamahuhu’s mentorship, Jorge leads a team of eight in producing 400 pairs of shoes a month and has achieved his dream of buying a car. </p>
<p>‘Strata’ separates social class in Columbia, implementing a huge pay gap (between 300€ and 5,000€/month, depending on strata). “Below strata three means a lack of resources, security and means to produce,” says Luis. “We keep workshops on strata two and three and hope artisans become strata four or five.” Jorge now earns seven times what he used to, meaning, vitally, he can finally pay his taxes and health insurance. This is rare among Columbian artisans and allows him to climb strata.</p>

<h2>"My biggest pleasure is paying others at the end of the week, because I know how good they feel. My workshop is now sustainable, and I have a more certain future."</h2>

  <p>
“The artisans have many more expenses – they pay salaries, have bigger workshops and more machines,” says Luis, “but they are becoming entrepreneurs.” Mamahuhu has given Jorge the confidence to hire people, form a team and invest in new machines, transforming him from a cobbler with the knowledge of a master artisan into a bona fide businessman. He says, “Being a businessman is not easy, but I wouldn’t change it. My biggest pleasure is paying others at the end of the week, because I know how good they feel. That I use my time to lead others and design, instead of just repairing shoes, is the best gift. My workshop is now sustainable, and I have a more certain future.” </p>
<p>
Technology has proved key their success. They have installed Skype and Whatsapp in every workshop so artisans can be in contact or seek support 24/7. The Mamahuhu accountant is working with Jorge to teach him to manage his own accounts. He will be able to approach other companies over email and Skype and send them official invoices. </p>
<p>
“Having a young brand behind artisans makes people keen to work in the workshops, because they trust it and know they are going to get paid,” says Luis. This means young generations are now flocking to work in Mamahuhu workshops, reigniting the tradition of Colombian leather artisanship. Jorge says, “Leather shoes and my family are my life. My son is now part of my business and we are maintaining an important tradition.”</p>
<p>
  Jorge is one of 120 artisans that Mamahuhu have worked with using the same method.

  <p><em>(Mamahuhu is on the brink of global expansion)</em></p>
  <h1>Expansion</h1>
  <p>
In 2013, Mamahuhu returned to Kickstarter to raise funds to open their first store in Bogotá. It was quickly struck by disaster. “Our shop was broken into and everything we had was stolen – all of our machines, our shoes, absolutely everything.” Unwilling to surrender, they appealed once more on Kickstarter, receiving €20,000 to reopen the shop in and an invitation to New York Fashion Week. “We opened the shop again and used the revenue to open the second. Now we have eight shops and have never had an investment. At Fashion Week, we were spotted and published in British Vogue.” </p>
  <p>
Four years in, Mamahuhu is grabbing attention. They are a street trend in Colombia, known as the brand that employs artisans. Carolina is Creative Director. “She is inspired by the vibrant colour of Columbia,” says Luis. “It’s everywhere, from the food, to the people, to the climate. She is also inspired by her travels – we make Oxford shoes, because we lived there. You can feel it’s made in Colombia, but at the same time, it’s international. In our shops, the colourful shoes look like exotic fruits.”</p>
  <p>
Is it all too good to be true?  With growth, surely something has to slip? “No. It’s really easy,” says Luis, “for every shop we open, we will open a new workshop. By 2020, we should have 25 workshops and 25 shops, each workshop less than one hour away from its partner shop.  We will match how we grow in sales with how we grow in production. In Columbia 100 workshops close every year – those, we can absorb.” </p>
  <p>
“Not only is our brand exportable, but also the whole business structure,” says Luis, who is currently in Granada, Spain, opening the first workshop abroad. It will supply the Granada store, which opened last year, and, as of September, the new store in Barcelona. “We can have workshops anywhere that a leather industry is dying. Social value can exist anywhere that there are people with the know-how, but without the resources.” True to their word, Luis and Carolina will move to Athens next January for three months to open their first workshop in Greece. </p>
  <p>
To keep their image fresh, they employ under 30’s to run their stores (in Spain, 60% of under 30’s are unemployed). “When educating new generations in ethical buying, who better to tell you than a peer?” says Luis, “people from university might get served by one of their classmates.” </p>
<p>
Such is the sustainable business model that could save the industry. As popular opinion turns more than ever towards ethical buying, Livia Firth of Eco Age says, “If a company wants to be successful in 20 years time, they have to start making changes today, otherwise resources will run out and factory workers will rebel.” </p>
<p>
For budding entrepreneurs, Luis has one piece of advice: “If you want to start a brand and are looking for an investment to order a minimum quantity of 2,000 units from a factory, you’re doing it wrong. Start with 50 handmade units, maybe even in your own neighbourhood. You’ll have quality, control and it’s socially valuable. As an entrepreneur, it’s easier to make things ethically than the bad way.”</p>
